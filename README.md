# AdventOfCode2022

This is my attempt at [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about).

Also included is my estimation of the time complexity (Time / Space). As is standard, if the input needs to be saved
to a variable in some way that does not affect the Space complexity.

For those days where I have not yet completed both parts, I will not be pushing my solutions
(to give me time to work on them :)).

This year I'm learning Rust, so I'll provide solutions in Python **and** Rust.
